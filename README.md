Advert sharing platform. 

ABSTRACT

Nowadays, the mobile platform, which attracts the attention of software developers with its large number of users, has met on a common ground with the largest sector; the consumption sector, and many applications and solutions have been offered to users. However, although there are mobile applications available to meet our needs, unfortunately, there is no complete and special application that is planned for a special environment and contains features that we cannot see together in most applications. In this project, we developed an application which offers a safe and anonymous mobile platform that facilitates communication among people within a university, and where they can get results on campus without the need to use long methods to meet their needs.In this application, everyone on campus will be able to open any kind of advertisement with their own identity, whether it is a study colleague, a traveling companion who will accompany him on the way to the campus in the morning, someone to sell his/her unused guitar or to attract students to the school club, with advertisements in any way he/she wants. . Our project alone contains the features of applications such as letgo, sahibinden, blablacar, and kommunity.
